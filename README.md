### **Project Introduction â€“ NeutralinoJS + SvelteKit Hybrid**

Before getting started, make sure you have **Node.js** and **NeutralinoJS** installed on your system.

This project combines the simplicity of **NeutralinoJS** for lightweight desktop applications with the power of **SvelteKit** for building dynamic frontend interfaces.

While you can use standard `npm` or `npx` to build and run the SvelteKit frontend, I highly recommend giving **Bun** a try â€” it's incredibly fast and works seamlessly with modern JS tooling. However, Bun is **completely optional** and not a requirement.

> In short: Node is required, Bun is optional â€” but once you try it, you might not want to go back ðŸ˜‰
